Project for Code Louisville Front End. This is the front end of my conference room reservation page. It uses JavaScript, jQuery and is responsive. JavaScript function in app.js aids in making page responsive. When you click on a floor button a drop down menu appears taking you to a form. The calendar is responsive when selecting a day.
